  \caption{The naive process of how a verifier establishes trust in an \ac{fTPM} is done by trusting its manufacturer. The brown markers indicate a manufacturer. The firmware~(FW) and the fTPM were built by manufacturer \(\mathcal{M}\), and the EK certificate references this manufacturer.}\label{fig:current_state}
