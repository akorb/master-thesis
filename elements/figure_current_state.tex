  \caption{The naive process how a verifier establishes trust to an \ac{fTPM}, which is in fact done by trusting its manufacturer. The brown markers indicate a manufacturer. The firmware~(FW) and the fTPM were built by manufacturer \(\mathcal{M}\), and the EK certificate indicates this manufacturer.}\label{fig:current_state}
