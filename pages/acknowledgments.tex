I want to take this opportunity to thank all those who have supported me in preparing this thesis.
My thanks go to my supervisor Prof.\ Dr.\ Claudia Eckert, who gave me the opportunity to write this thesis.
I would also like to thank my advisors, Albert Stark and Johannes Wiesböck, who patiently stood by my side and answered all my questions.
Without their help and support, this thesis would not have been possible, and I am sure they have helped me immensely to start my journey in the field of cyber security.
Lastly, I would like to thank all my friends who have been patient and understanding while writing this thesis and have sacrificed their time to proofread my work.

This work was created at the `Fraunhofer-Institut für Angewandte und Integrierte Sicherheit AISEC' in Garching.
It is part of the `Fraunhofer Society for the Promotion of Applied Research e.~V.', an organization distributed over Europe focusing mainly on applied research.
