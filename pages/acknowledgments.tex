I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those who have supported me in the preparation of this thesis.
My thanks go to my supervisor Prof.\ Dr.\ Claudia Eckert, who gave me the opportunity to write this thesis.
I would also like to express my special thanks to my advisors Albert Stark and Johannes Wiesböck, who patiently stood by my side and answered all my questions.
Without their help and support, this thesis would not have been possible, and I am sure they have helped me greatly to start my journey in the field of cyber security.
Last but not least, I would like to thank all my friends who have been patient and understanding during the writing of this thesis and who have sacrificed their time to proofread my work.

This work was created at the `Fraunhofer-Institut für Angewandte und Integrierte Sicherheit AISEC' in Garching.
It is part of the `Fraunhofer Society for the Promotion of Applied Research e.~V.', which is an organization distributed over Europe with main focus on applied research.
