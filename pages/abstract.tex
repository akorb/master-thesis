TPMs are authenticated by getting to know their manufacturer, who guarantees the fulfillment of the TPM specification to ensure its security properties.
While this approach is sufficient for hardware TPMs since they are independent chips, it assumes for firmware TPMs that the manufacturer of the firmware TPM is the same as the one of all firmware components booted before the firmware TPM\@.
That is due to the fact that each preceding firmware component can compromise the firmware TPM while loading it.
The verifier in the remote attestation process has no way of verify the entire boot chain up to the firmware TPM\@.
We propose a remote attestation system which enables the verifier to do that.
For that, we introduce a new hardware root of trust implementing DICE\@.
The verifier only needs to trust the manufacturer of DICE, while everything beyond is explicitly attested by propagating their entity to the verifier.
This allows the manufacturer of the firmware TPM and every preceding component to be independent.
Our system also binds the fTPM's data to the fTPM's identity, such that its data is not accessible anymore when the fTPM or any preceding firmware component is modified, or potentially compromised.
