A complementary approach is to verify the code of TPMs \cite{Mukhamedov2013}. Here, the TPM 1.2 code is written in a functional programming language that enables automatic verification. However, with this approach, a third party cannot ensure that the verified version actually runs on the device under test. However, this approach fits well with our approach, namely to certify that a verified TPM runs on the device under test.
