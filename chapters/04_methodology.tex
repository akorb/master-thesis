\section{Architectural overview}

% S-RTM = DICE

% EK = AK: Takes on both roles. Endorsement key always represents identity, therefore, we lose privacy. Later an approach with privacy is presented.
% However, we don't require a privacy CA, but instead trust the manufacturer of our trust anchor directly (DICE), which is sufficient for our approach.

\section{Chaining DICE and TPM certificate infrastructure}

\section{Provisioning process}

% To summarize, attestation key provisioning must ensure that only valid attestation key material is established in Attesters [RFC 9334]

\section{Attestation process}

% Check also for revocation of manufacturer cert

\section{Updating the fTPM}

% fTPM update only possible while system is shut down. This ensures that the TCI part of the EKcert generated at boot-time does not become obsolete, in other words, keeps representing the state of the currently running fTPM.

\section{Privacy}

% Maybe: The certificates would need to be encrypted as well, as they contain the TCI values, potentially identifying the device
